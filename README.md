# -Smart-Stick-for-Visually-Impaired
A cutting-edge smart stick using the Arduino-Nano microcontroller, featuring a built-in buzzer and vibration system to aid the visually impaired in detecting fire, obstacles, and water
Firsty, we designed the cicruit for detecting any substance/obstacle using the ultra sonic sensor with a buzzer which will buzz whenever it will sense an obstacle with less than 20 cm.
Secondly, we designed the circuit for detecting the water and high temperature (above 40 degree) for which we used and LM35 . We integrated these sensors seperately with the buzzers. 
Lastly, we designed cases for placing and attaching them with the stick using Solidworks.
We placed the ultra sonic sensor in one seperate case with 2 holes for the sensor. This case was attached at the top of the stick whereas we placed both the water and temperature sensor in a same case and and we designed it such that the water sensor and and the temperature can be stick on the stick rather than in case and can detect the presennce of water and high temperature. This case was placed at the bottom of the stick.
